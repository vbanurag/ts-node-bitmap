## Typescript Node Bitmap Solve

Using typescipt node we are solving bitmap nearest distance to white.

### Tech Stack
- Node Js [16.13.2]
- TypeScript [4.0.3]
- Jest [For test]

### Problem Statement
There is given a rectangular bitmap of size n*m. Each pixel of the bitmap is either white or
black, but at least one is white. The pixel in i-th line and j-th column is called the pixel (i,j). The
distance between two pixels p1=(i1,j1) and p2=(i2,j2) is defined as d(p1,p2)=|i1-i2|+|j1-j2|.

### Input

```

### Output
```
3 2 1 0
2 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
```
